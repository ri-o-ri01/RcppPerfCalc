\title{Calculate Annualized Standard Deviation (Risk)}
\usage{
annualized_sd(x, scale)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of returns. Each value represents the return
for a specific period.}

\item{scale}{An integer that represents the number of periods in a year
(e.g., 252 for daily returns, 12 for monthly returns).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the annualized standard deviation.
}
\description{
This function computes the annualized standard deviation (risk) of a series
of returns. Missing values (NA) are removed before calculation.
}
\examples{
returns <- c(0.01, 0.02, 0.015, -0.02, 0.03)
annualized_sd(returns, 252)
}
